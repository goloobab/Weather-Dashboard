# Weather-Dashboard
This app that allows users to search and see the weather forecast for cities of their choosing.

## Description 

This project is a Weather Dashboard written and developed using Javascript/jQuery, Html and bootsrap. With the help of the Openweather API. The user will be able to enter a city name of there choice and on clicking the search button the current weather statsitics will be presented along with a 5 day weather forecast of the same city. History will be stored for the Recent 9 cities search for and buttons present for easy navigation.

## Task
Builing a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Acceptance Criteria:

Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.

When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

#### When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
* The city name
* The date
* An icon representation of weather conditions
* The temperature
* The humidity
* The wind speed

#### When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
* The date
* An icon representation of weather conditions
* The temperature
* The humidity

#### When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

## Challenges

* Determing the right time stamp to use. 
* Manuplating the local storage to limit the display history.
* Accessing saved records from the local storage.
* Returning the arrays in a sorted format.

## Things I learned 
* How useful it is to break down code using functions
* Using API's responses as input data for other API calls/queries
* Returning objects from a function.
* The importance on emptying a container.
* The importance of reading API documentation.
